This is for me to host my code as I follow along with the Crafting Interpreters book by Robert Nystrom

The goal is to build an interpreter for the language [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. This involves learning about tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.
